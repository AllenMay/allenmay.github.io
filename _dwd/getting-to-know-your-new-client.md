<div class="well" id="wells">A client is a person looking for your professional advice or service. This person might represent a business needing a new website or maybe they're a marketing manager from a large organization.</div>

Are clients needing help with a complex project or do they need some consulting advice? Have they given this project a lot of thought or do they just need Our clients are diverse and their needs could be even more diverse.  

Before doing any design or development work, we should get to know the client needs. There should be a "discovery" phase built into your processes.

**What questions need answered?**  
To help understand the "discovery" phase, I spoke with group member **Darren Kall** of Kall Consulting. They specialize in customer and user experience design and strategy.

**Here is good advice from Darren:**  
*   *Avoiding putting forms on your website that ask qualifying questions for new clients.* You should talk with your client and get to know them. Filling a web form makes the client feel under-valued.  
*   *Expect at least one planed "discovery" meeting with a new client.* A planned meeting gives you and the client time to prepare thoughts for the project.  
*   *Always guide the client to a "statement of work" agreement.* The statement of work is the agreement that they will pay you for your services.  

**So what questions should the Dayton Web Developers ask ourselves about our new website?**  
*   *Who will manage the website?* The website will be managed by Nathan Ramback and Allen May. It will be available through a GitHub repository where contributors do submit pull requests.  
*   *What content do you want on the website?* The website will initially be a central location for the Dayton Web Developers branding. Having a dedicated page will allow future projects as needed.
