On 6/26/2015 Priyanka Bole (Hobart Service) and I gave a presentation to the **Business Intelligence special interest group** on the topic of "Presentation / Visualization / Self-Service". 

I talked about and presented screenshots of the SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) portal I created for CompuNet that allows managers to create a variety of reports on test turnaround times. 

Priyanka walked through the self-service reporting tool Hobart staff use. She also VPN'ed into their neetwork to give a LIVE demonstration of their reporting toolset.
