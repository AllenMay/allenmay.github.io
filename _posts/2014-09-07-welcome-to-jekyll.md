I am building my GitHub pages with Jekyll and exploring the differences between the GitHub site Layout templates.
I'm also exploring the Jekyll themes and trying to incorporate what I like into the right blend of design and functionality.

Ha! I'll never get this site up...

I'm finishing this edit and committing to GitHub so I can salvage some of my day.

Tomorrow morning becomes for more work on this site....

Until then... [commit]
