As I get to know Windows 7 I will post helpful tidbits here.

Where did my **user profile** go?

You used to find your profile information under **c:\documents and settings\\**. You will now find it under **c:\Users\\**

Where did the **SendTo** folder go?

When I wanted to add an application to the right-mouse-click SendTo list, I would add a shortcut to my application in the **c:\documents and settings\\\<userprofile>\SendTo** folder. With Windows 7 you will have to go a little deeper. Instead of Documents and Settings, you go to **c:\Users\\** and then to **\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo**. 

The full path:
**c:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo**
