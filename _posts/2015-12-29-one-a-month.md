I wanted to be more proactive about building my website portfolio using different technologies for each site. If each site uses a different technique then I'll broaden my experience and keep things from feeling repetitive.  
I decided to give myself a challenge to __complete one website a month__, every month, through the year 2016. At the end of this challenge I will have 12 examples of websites I've created. 

Sounds easy enough, you can build a WordPress website minutes, but what type of portfolio do I want at the end of this project? I want to stretch myself without being too complicated. Each month project will need to be a balanced so it's a challenge but can be completed within a month. I will also need to budget my time and pace my work so I'm not tempted to work beyond a month or "double-up" on projects.
