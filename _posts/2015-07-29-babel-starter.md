This morning I walked through an insightful video tutorial from __Tuts+__ called \"[Full Stack ES6 with Babel] [tut]\". In this 9 minute video [Jason Green] [jason] not only demonstrates how to install and configure the __Node.js__ modules he tells you some background on the modules and why you need them.  

After about 15 minutes of twiddling I had a fully automated __Gulp__ \"skeleton\" build with __Babel__ integrated to allow me to use __ES6__ code in my project.  

Very cool and great foundation. Thanks Jason!
