Since I can't seem to lock on a project target I'm going to start 
listing random thoughts.

I'll post back to this post, with timestamp every time I have an idea for a project.

* __10/31/2014 - Create an Ember.js / Firebase app at work to do the following:__
  * Verify I can use Firebase throught the firewall
  * Start using Ember.js more
  * Add more useable tools to the IntrAnet


* __10/31/2014 - Use the Javascript from a previous project (payment office) do do the following:__
  * Create Jasmine testing
  * Use pre-compilers for Javascript and CSS
  * Document/blog all I learned
