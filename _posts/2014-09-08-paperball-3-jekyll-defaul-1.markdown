## **MISSION:** Create a Central Profile Blog Using GitHub Pages

<img src="/images/paperballOPTIMIZED.svg" alt="Paperball" class="post-icon">

I had a great idea - use GitHub Pages as my central blog for projects and interest. Sounds
simple enough, right? Well it is simple if you keep focus on the project priority, start with the basics and explore your options later.

I found myself exploring Jekyll, Jekyll themes and the GitHub Layout themes. I wanted to have the best parts of what each had to offer and found myself drifting away from the mission.
I had to "paper ball" my efforts 3 times before accepting the fact that I had gone off target and needed to get back to the original goal.
