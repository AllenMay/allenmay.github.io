__I Really Mean To... Really!__

Ok, I've got Jekyll figured out. I'm GIT'ing and SASS'ing.. I should be cranking out post after post but reality is [not].

I am going to post something at minimum once a week. Period!

Let's see.. what's the next topic gonna be.. I know!! Jasmine.
I'll follow up with some Jasmine walk-through.

Ooh! then, after that, I can walk through some Firebase stuff.

This could be fun.

Until then..
