I wanted to evaluate Drupal 6.13 and thought I would mimick the web host’s config as close as possible. Here is a list of the fun I went through =:)

1. I downloaded a VMServer appliance from [http://www.thoughtpolice.co.uk/vmware/] [dl1]:  

- “CentOS 5.3, server install. new! Long Term Support (until 2014!) [permalink] [dl2]“  
..and downloaded Drupal 6.13 to it

- [http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-6.13.tar.gz] [dl3]  
To make things easier, I decided to install the latest version of phpMyAdmin (3.2.0.1)

- [phpMyAdmin-3.2.0.1-english.tar.gz] [dl4]  
..but found it would not run on the version of PHP that CentOS supported – Version 5.1.6. When I tried to do a YUM updated, it said I was on the latest version.. but phpMyAdmin said I needed a newer version (5.2.0) I backed down to phpMyAdmin version 2.11.9.5 and finally got it installed

- [phpMyAdmin-2.11.9.5-english.tar.gz] [dl5]
So.. I begin the Drupal install and find folder permission issues with the install.
Resolution: I was missing the top folder permission – sites.. once I made Apache owner of it, I could proceed.

On to the next screen.. which complained about a missing PHP extension – **mbstring**

Resolution\: YUM to the rescue again:  
<pre>
>yum install php-mbstring
>service httpd restart
</pre>

The install proceeded marvelously after that =:)
