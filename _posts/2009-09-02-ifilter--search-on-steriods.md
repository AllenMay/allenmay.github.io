I just followed the instructions from Ramesh Srinivasan’s blog post – [Adobe IFilter Plugin] [plugin] – and I’m very impressed. My search-in-files are bringing back PDF results of all my PDF’s. This is hugely helpful considering I keep a lot of knowledge in PDF files. It works in both Windows XP native searches (vs. Windows Search) and UltraEdit. I just ran the install from Adobe, rebooted and “happy hooey” it’s searching on steroids!
