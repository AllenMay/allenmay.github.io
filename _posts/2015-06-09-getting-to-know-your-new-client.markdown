<p class="commentor">For our new website we should ask ourselves the same questions we should ask our clients. Let's take a closer look at the early discussions with a new client project.</p>

# Exploring the early relationship with a new a Client #
<img src="/images/ClientMeeting.svg" alt="Client Meeting" class="postright">

A client is a person looking for your professional advice or service. This person might be from a new business needing a new website or maybe they're a marketing manager from a large organization. 

Are they needing your help with a complex project or do they need some consulting advice?  

Our clients are diverse and their needs could be even more diverse.

**So let's ask some questions:**  
*   What do you think you should know before starting work on a new client project?  
*   What does the client expect from you?  
*   What would you want them to start thinking about?
