I have been part of the Information Technology / Computer Systems Engineering 
field for over 20 years. I have a wide variety of experience in networking, 
enterprise architecture support, database development and administration. But I always finds himself 
coming back to my true passion - working with modern web technologies that serve client or public interest.

My breadth of knowledge spans across the Microsoft, Apple and Unix/Linux environments. I am comfortable with a Windows, Mac or a Linux desktop.

My depth of knowledge has been in PHP, C# and MS-SQL development. I have also spent a lot of time working with Perl scripting for automation and data conversion.
I have spent a lot of time supporting and customizing SugarCRM (a php-based CRM web application) and WordPress (one of the most popular php-based blog/content management system)

I would consider myself a "full stack" engineer, frequently I will build my servers, configure them to the needs of the application, and develop the applications needed for that project.
